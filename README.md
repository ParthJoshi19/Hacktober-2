# Basic Song Application




This project implements a basic song management application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add songs to a playlist, but there are several known issues that need to be addressed for it to work correctly.

**Features**

Add Songs: Users can enter a song title and artist name and add them to the playlist.

Dynamic Playlist: Songs are displayed dynamically in a list format on the webpage.

Manage Playlist: Placeholder buttons for playing and removing songs from the playlist.

A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (optional).

# Extended Overview of the App


The Basic Song Application allows users to dynamically create and manage a playlist. The app's minimalistic UI includes two input fields for the song title and artist, a button to add songs to the list, and action buttons to interact with the playlist.


Upon adding a song, the title and artist are displayed in a neatly formatted list. The application is designed to be intuitive, but it currently lacks some functionality and error-handling capabilities that are critical for improving the user experience.



**Additional App Features (Include These in Your README):**

Minimal UI: The app features a clean, user-friendly interface that enables users to manage their songs in just a few clicks.

Dynamic Playlist Management: Songs are dynamically added to the playlist with the input provided by the user.

Play and Remove Functionality: The interface provides buttons to play and remove songs from the playlist, although some features are not fully implemented yet.

Responsive Design: The app adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring itâ€™s usable across devices.
